        <span>1. Why should I reuse my cup?</span>

          Each year over 300 billion single-use coffee cups are manufactured globally. Due to their plastic content, less than 2% will ever be
        </p>
        <p>recycled. As takeaway drink consumption grows, so does the problem of waste.</p>

      <button class="accordion">
        <span>3. How do I remove tea/coffee stains?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>We would recommend the following cleaning method to aid in removing the tea/coffee stains:</p>
        <p>Materials:</p>
        <p>• Baking Soda, 1 tablespoon</p>
        <p>• Hot Boiling Water</p>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <p>1. Place baking soda into the tumbler/mug and fill it with hot boiling water.</p>
        <p>2. Place the silicone ring and silicone gasket into the tumbler/mug.</p>
        <p>3. Close it with the lid and set it aside to soak for 1 hour.</p>
        <p>4. Discard water. Rinse and wash tumbler thoroughly with a soft sponge and gentle dish-washing soap.</p>

      <button class="accordion">
        <span>4.  Will there be a chemical reaction when storing acidic tea/coffee in the stainless steel products?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>As the acidic contents in tea and coffee is low, the food-grade Stainless Steel is safe to store them for hours. However, we would recommend to first rinse the umbler/mug with water (best with hot water) to remove residues that may pick up the washing liquid during cleaning.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        <span>5. What drinks should I not use in my cup?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>See individual cup/bottle instructions but stainless steel products are not suitable for use with carbonated drinks, dry ice, water soluble vitamins, dairy products, fruit juice, and drinks /soups with a high salt content.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        <span>6. Is my Cup dishwasher safe ?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Follow the care instructions, supplied with your product and shown online.
          Putting your cup in the dishwasher may reduce the life of the cup,
        </p>
        <p>it is always better to hand wash your cup. </p>
        <p>The body of the cup, if it states dishwasher safe on the instructions, maybe placed on the top rack only.</p>
        <p>Do not put your lid through the dishwasher, as this could degrade the materials, and could cause the seal to break </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        <span>7. Is my cup recyclable?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Recycling Facilities differ. Before discarding your old reusable cup, we'd strongly recommend contacting your local council/government to confirm recyclability. All our products are made from BPA free & FDA/EU approved materials.</p>

      <button class="accordion">
        <span>8. All cups differ slightly but what are the basic things to be aware of when using a travel mug?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>• If possible do not fill with liquids over 90°C (194°F). Extremely hot liquids can cause pressure build up, which can lead to ejection of liquid and scalding.</p>
        <p>• Always let your drink cool to a drinkable temperature before putting on your lid, to avoid pressure build-up. Always open the lid on the cup/bottle in an upright position away from the face. Hot liquid can cause serious injury.</p>
        <p>• Do not shake your cup / bottle, and keep upright at all times.</p>
        <p>• Do not over-fill. </p>
        <p>• Ensure your lid is fully tightened  (pushed-on) before use.</p>
        <p>• It is difficult to judge the temperature of your beverage through the insulated walls so please be careful.</p>
        <p>• KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</p>
        <p>• Do not Microwave.</p>
        <p>• Do not Freeze.</p>
        <p>• Do not soak. </p>
        <p>• Hand clean before first use and wash after each use.</p>
        <p>• Do not use any cleaning brushes made of metal or hard plastic, and never rinse using scouring agents, solutions or bleaches</p>
